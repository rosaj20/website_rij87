I was terrified when computational statistics was the only class that fulfilled one of the last biology courses I needed to take to graduate. I was hoping to not have such a stressful semester, and with SDS 348, that seemed nearly impossible. However, the impossible turned out to be very possible. I enjoyed this class more than I thought I would. It proved to be a fun and useful tool for data interpretation. R is what I used to create my BDP poster plots and derive conclusions. Directly after learning about it, I was using R to apply it to a real-life situation!

Thank you for a wonderful semester, for always being available to help, for pushing students to do better than they thought they could, and for sharing your love of these two programming languages. My puzzle of coding language is not yet complete, but I can already see the wonderful picture that is slowly coming together.

```{python}
print("Goodbye World! No more code, but only for a little bit.")
```
